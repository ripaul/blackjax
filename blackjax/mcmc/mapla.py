    """Implements the (basic) user interface for the MALA kernel.

    The general mala kernel builder (:meth:`blackjax.mcmc.mala.build_kernel`, alias `blackjax.mala.build_kernel`) can be
    cumbersome to manipulate. Since most users only need to specify the kernel
    parameters at initialization time, we provide a helper function that
    specializes the general kernel.

    We also add the general kernel and state generator as an attribute to this class so
    users only need to pass `blackjax.mala` to SMC, adaptation, etc. algorithms.

    Examples
    --------

    A new MALA kernel can be initialized and used with the following code:

    .. code::

        mala = blackjax.mala(logdensity_fn, step_size)
        state = mala.init(position)
        new_state, info = mala.step(rng_key, state)

    Kernels are not jit-compiled by default so you will need to do it manually:

    .. code::

       step = jax.jit(mala.step)
       new_state, info = step(rng_key, state)

    Should you need to you can always use the base kernel directly:

    .. code::

       kernel = blackjax.mala.build_kernel(logdensity_fn)
       state = blackjax.mala.init(position, logdensity_fn)
       state, info = kernel(rng_key, state, logdensity_fn, step_size)

    Parameters
    ----------
    logdensity_fn
        The log-density function we wish to draw samples from.
    step_size
        The value to use for the step size in the symplectic integrator.

    Returns
    -------
    A ``SamplingAlgorithm``.
